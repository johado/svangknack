Sv√§ngknack card game simulator

The idea is to simulate the game, and come up with good strategies.

One way could be to try all different possible combinations of a game round,
and determine how much choice can influence the end result and try to determine
what choices are good and what they can/should be based upon.

Is the only winning move not to play?
